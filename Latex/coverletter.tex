The HostOS or Hypervisor constitutes the most important cornerstone of today's commercial cloud environment security. Unfortunately, the HostOS/Hypervisor, especially the QEMU-KVM architecture, is not immune to all vulnerabilities and exploitations. In this paper, we present a novel scheme, named HyperPS, to implement virtual machine protection under the compromised HostOS/Hypervisor. The key idea of HyperPS is to deprive the HostOS/Hypervisor of the privileges of managing the physical memory into an isolated and trusted execution environment. HyperPS does not rely customized hardware or extra processor privilege. HyperPS shares the same privilege with the HostOS.
