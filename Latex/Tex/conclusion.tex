\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
We introduce HyperPS, an approach that enables x86 platforms to support a secure isolated execution environment at the same privilege-level with hypervisor. The environment is designed to provide memory isolation protection for VMs, and event-driven runtime monitoring for interaction between hypervisor and VM. This approach, which does not rely on additional hardware devices or a higher privilege level software, has fewer changes to system and fewer requirements for types of CPU hardware device. It reflects good practicality, portability, and independence on multi-platforms. And security analysis describes protection for VM and HyperPS itself, the performance evaluation shows its efficiency by introducing negligible performance overhead. It can be implemented widely in real-world for cloud providers.
