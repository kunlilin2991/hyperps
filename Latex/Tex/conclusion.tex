\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
We introduce HyperPS, an approach that enables x86 platforms to support a secure isolated execution environment at the same privilege-level with hypervisor. The environment is designed to provide memory isolation protection for VMs under the condition that the HostOS/hypervisor has already been compromised. 
% and event-driven runtime monitoring for interaction between hypervisor and VM. 
This approach does not rely on additional hardware devices or a higher privilege level software. HyperPS also does not rely on special types of processor architecture or special kernel version.
%  has fewer changes to system and fewer requirements for types of CPU hardware device. 
HyperPS reflects good practicality, portability, and independence on multi-platforms. Besides, evaluation shows that HyperPS does not introduce unacceptable negligible performance overhead. We support that HyperPS can be implemented widely in real-world for cloud providers.
